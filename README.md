# YADS: Yet Another Darcy Solver
## Context 
This library has been developed during Antoine Lechevallier's thesis. It is a sandbox with two main functionalities: 

    - run reservoir simulations for CO2 storage
    - couple simulations with machine learning models

## Installation (Not working yet)

Still working on proper installation, but numpy alone allows to run most of the scripts 
    
## Launch tests

    pytest -vvv tests
## Funds
The thesis was financed by:
    - DIM Math Innov (see https://www.dim-mathinnov.fr )
    - IFP Energies Nouvelles (see https://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.fr )
    - Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions (see https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr )
